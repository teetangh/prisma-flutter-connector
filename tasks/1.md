I've completed comprehensive research on Flutter/Dart
technologies for your Prisma-to-Flutter connector project. Here's what I
found:

Key Research Findings:

1. Code Generation (Recommended: Freezed + json_serializable)

- Freezed 2.5.8 + json_serializable 6.7.1 - Best for immutable, type-safe
  models
- build_runner 2.4.6 - Core generation engine
- ⚠️ Prisma Dart is suspended until mid-2025 due to Prisma's migration to
  TypeScript

2. API Clients

- Dio - Recommended for REST (30% more connections, 20% faster than
  alternatives)
- Retrofit - Type-safe API client generator (works with Dio)
- graphql_flutter - Recommended for GraphQL with caching/subscriptions
- web_socket_channel - For real-time WebSocket subscriptions

3. Offline Storage

- Drift - Recommended for structured data (type-safe SQLite ORM, similar
  to Prisma)
- Hive - Fastest reads (<1ms), good for simple caching (though
  deprecation planned)
- ObjectBox - 70x faster but requires commercial license
- ⚠️ Avoid Isar - Abandoned by author despite performance

Recommended Tech Stack:

dependencies:
dio: ^5.0.0 # HTTP client
graphql_flutter: latest # GraphQL (optional)
web_socket_channel: latest # Subscriptions
freezed_annotation: ^2.4.1 # Model generation
json_annotation: ^4.8.1
drift: latest # Database/caching

dev_dependencies:
build_runner: ^2.4.6
freezed: ^2.5.8
json_serializable: ^6.7.1
retrofit_generator: latest # API client gen
drift_dev: latest

     I've gathered comprehensive information about Flutter/Dart
     technologies for your Prisma-Flutter connector:

     1. Code Generation Tools - Freezed, json_serializable, build_runner
     (with caveat: Prisma Dart suspended until mid-2025)
     2. API Client Libraries - Dio, Retrofit, graphql_flutter,
     web_socket_channel
     3. Offline Storage - Drift (recommended), Hive, ObjectBox (avoid Isar)

     Next Steps (if you want to proceed):

     1. Set up project structure with recommended dependencies
     2. Create base models using Freezed + json_serializable
     3. Implement API layer with Dio + Retrofit for REST or graphql_flutter
      for GraphQL
     4. Set up Drift database for offline caching
     5. Create code generation pipeline to convert Prisma schema → Dart
     models
     6. Implement repository pattern for offline-first data access

     Would you like me to start implementing any of these components?

I've completed comprehensive research on Flutter/Dart
  technologies for your Prisma-to-Flutter connector project. Here's a
  summary of the key findings:

  📊 Research Summary

  Code Generation ⭐ Recommended: Freezed + json_serializable

  - Latest versions: freezed: ^2.5.8, json_serializable: ^6.7.1
  - Provides immutable models, automatic copyWith, JSON serialization
  - ⚠️ Important: Official Prisma Dart is suspended until mid-2025, so
  you'll need custom schema-to-model generation

  API Clients

  - REST: Dio (30% faster) + Retrofit for type-safe code generation
  - GraphQL: graphql_flutter (easiest, full-featured) + graphql_codegen
  - WebSockets: web_socket_channel for real-time subscriptions

  Offline Storage ⭐ Recommended: Drift

  - Type-safe SQLite ORM (similar philosophy to Prisma)
  - Reactive streams, ACID transactions, migration support
  - Alternative: Hive for simple key-value caching (fastest reads <1ms)
  - ⚠️ Avoid Isar (abandoned by author)

  Recommended Architecture

  Prisma Backend (Node/TS) → GraphQL/REST API
                            → Flutter SDK (Dio/GraphQL client)
                            → Drift cache (offline-first)
                            → Freezed models (type-safe)

  What would you like to do next?

  1. Start implementation - Set up project structure with dependencies
  2. Create prototype - Build a minimal working example
  3. Design the SDK API - Define the Flutter developer experience
  4. Just review findings - You have all the research you need

  Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
